"""
Environment-specific settings for GOATS.

This package contains optional overrides applied after base.py, dynamic.py,
and generated.py have loaded. The loader in settings/__init__.py selects one of
these modules based on the GOATS_ENV environment variable:

    GOATS_ENV=development   →   development.py
    GOATS_ENV=production    →   production.py
    GOATS_ENV=cli           →   cli.py

These modules SHOULD NOT define a full settings configuration. They exist only
to override or replace values defined in the base layer. Users should not modify
this directory; instead, user-level customizations belong in local.py.
