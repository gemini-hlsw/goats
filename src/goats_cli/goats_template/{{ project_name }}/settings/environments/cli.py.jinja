"""
CLI environment overrides for GOATS.

This module is loaded when GOATS_ENV=cli. It replaces Django's logging
configuration with a minimal, silent setup so that management commands invoked
by the GOATS CLI (such as migrations and createsuperuser) produce no logging
noise or file output.

This environment should never be used for running the application server.

User-specific adjustments (if needed) belong in local.py rather than this file.
