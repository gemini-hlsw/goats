Chrome extension v1: The initial version of the Chrome extension has been implemented, paving the way for enhanced browser functionality. A custom exception handling mechanism has been integrated within the GOATS Click, improving user experience in the command line interface. Additionally, a new CLI command facilitates the straightforward installation of the Chrome extension, while modifications to the ANTARES plugin now allow for direct query creation from the extension. To round off these updates, a new view has been established to monitor browser extension push notifications.
