Overhaul recipe assignment logic: Abandoned reliance on observation types for assigning recipes. Transitioned to using recipes modules, instruments, and tags to manage file recipes. This change enables GOATS to efficiently segregate files by their respective recipes and further distinguish different objects that may require unique recipes. The update prepares GOATS for integrating new instruments.
