Optimized GitHub Actions and integrated HTML linting: GitHub Actions now operate selectively, with the HTML linter (`htmlhint`) triggered when template HTML files change, and unit tests and `flake8` checks run when Python files change. Additionally, common Jinja templating settings are now ignored by the HTML linter, thanks to the updated `htmlhint` configuration.
