    "**Note that it is important to start with process dark for F2 imaging to be generic and catch outlier case like the following. The step \"create BPM\" requires both short-darks and flats. For F2 imaging in Y, J, and H bands, both lamp-on and lamp-off flats are taken, which allow \"create BPM\" to NOT require a master dark frame (output from \"process dark\") -- it uses the lamp-off flats for this purpose. However, for K-band, only lamp-off flats are taken, which already has signal from the thermal emission and to remove the dark current, proper darks (when I say proper darks, I mean same exposure time as the flats) are required to remove the dark current in the flats. Here, the master dark from the \"process dark\" step needs to be used, so this step needs to precede \"create BPM\", while for the rest of the other filters it doesn't matter which one precedes.**   \n",
    "\n",
    "And a comment from Kathleen (just putting this here for myself): \"\"\"...However, you could argue that if all the darks are processed ahead of time, the BPM recipe could just use the already processed dark. But it probably would not associate anyway since they are “short dark” just the shortest dark that could be found in that time period...\"\"\" "
