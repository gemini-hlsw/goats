Below are the scince programs (observation IDs) I am using to prototype application of DRAGONS API. I have tried to cover the various instruments and observing modes of Gemini (see also https://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ and https://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.2.x/). 


Imaging
=========
GMOS imaging - GN-2015A-Q-86-5
F2 imaging - GS-2015B-Q-46-59
GSAOI imaging - GS-2019A-DD-107-13
**********************************************
Below are very low-priority for GOATS for dragons-imaging support 
GNIRS Keyhole imaging (only done at extreme circumstance) - GN-2011B-Q-34-155  
NIRI imaging (no longer supported) - GN-2015A-Q-55-51
**********************************************


Spectroscopy
=============
GMOS longlsit classic - GN-2018B-Q-315-11
GMOS longslit nod and shuffle - GN-2019B-Q-109-17, GN-2008B-Q-56-75 (these are from the DRAGONS tutorial examples)
GHOST Standard Resolution - 
GHOST High Resolution -
