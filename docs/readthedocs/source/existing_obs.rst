Add existing observation
------------------------

Users can add a past/existing Gemini observation of a target on GOATS to create a dedicated page for the given observation ID. 

.. note::  
   For Gemini observations, make sure that the ID you are adding is the *observation ID* and **not** the *program ID*. Then, click the ``Update Observation Status`` button to retrieve the status of the observation from the Gemini Observing Database. 

   If one would rather have the data for a given Gemini program ID, follow the instructions in :ref:`gem_program_ID`.
