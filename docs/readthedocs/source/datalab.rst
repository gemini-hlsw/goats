Interface with Astro Data Lab
-----------------------------

Users can connect to their |Dlab| account directly from the GOATS interface and thus avail the various data services offered by the former. Astro Data Lab is a science platform developed by NOIRLab; it provides a generous 1TB remote file storage per user along with the functionality to share data with other Astro Data Lab users. Additionally, it also hosts numerous photometric and spectrosopic survey catalogs as well as a Jupyter Hub environment. 

With the Astro Data Lab integration, users of GOATS can transfer data (including DRAGONS-reduced data) to the platform, carry out data analysis using a Jupyter notebook, including joint analysis with other data products hosted by Astro Data Lab, share the data with collaborators, and even use the platform for long-term hosting of their data products.  

.. note::

   Remember to register your Astro Data Lab credentials on GOATS (see :ref:`managing_credential`). This is required to be able to upload data from GOATS to your Astro Data Lab account.
  
The video below demonstrates this functionality on GOATS.
