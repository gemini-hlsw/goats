*antares2goats* is a browser extension that bridges the |ANTARES| portal and your local *GOATS* instance. It inspects the page URL on |ANTARES|, detects whether you are viewing a query or a single target, and transmits that information to *GOATS* for quick object creation. This streamlined process allows you to add targets or queries with just one click.

The extension is available for both **Google Chrome** and **Mozilla Firefox**. In the following sections, you will learn how to install and configure it, as well as how to use its status badges to understand the outcome of each action.
