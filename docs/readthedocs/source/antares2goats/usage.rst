*******************
Using The Extension
*******************

The *antares2goats* extension interfaces with the |ANTARES| by letting you quickly save 
queries or loci to your *GOATS* instance. The badge icon in your toolbar 
changes to reflect the current state.

Saving a Query
##############

1. Navigate to the |ANTARES| query page and apply the filters you want.
2. Click the *antares2goats* icon in your browser toolbar.
3. If successful, the icon changes to a green check, indicating the filtered query 
   was saved to *GOATS*.

Saving a Loci
#############

1. Open a specific |ANTARES| loci page.
2. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. A green check badge means the new target has been successfully added 
   to *GOATS*.
