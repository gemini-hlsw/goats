Interfacing with Transient Name Server
======================================

GOATS also supports communication with the `Transient Name Server <https://www.wis-tns.org/>`_ (TNS) by using the `tom-tns <https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_tns>`_ plugin, which is maintained by LCO. Users can thus submit transient discovery and/or classification report to TNS directly from the GOATS interface (see the video below). 

.. note::  

   Make sure to register your TNS credentials on GOATS (see :ref:`managing_credential`). This needs to be done only once and is required before you can submit any report to TNS.
