Fixed workflow state update retry logic for updating GPP observations. The retry mechanism now correctly invokes the asynchronous method to ensure reliable state updates. Also added missing parameters for linking an observation to the Gemini Explore page after fetching the observation status. Finally, corrected the template condition to properly check the observation status against completed states in a case-insensitive manner.
