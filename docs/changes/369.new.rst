Added a credential-management page for Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and SOAR that lets each user save their personal portal API token in the web interface. Observation submissions and whereever the api key is used now draw from the logged-in user's stored key, falling back to the project-wide key in settings.FACILITIES when necessary. The update introduces a dedicated model, view, template, and navigation link in the user settings, plus accompanying tests, and modifies the LCO and SOAR facility classes so they retrieve the key on a per-user basis.
