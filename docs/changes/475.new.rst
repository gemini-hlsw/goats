Introduced a new ModalManager to handle Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation creation, replacing toast notifications with modal dialogs to provide clearer feedback during long-running operations. The update added progress indicators and structured result tables for ToO creation, improved backend response messages with readable stage and status labels, and included new methods for managing observation button states and tracking active programs.
