Changed to use the development branch as the default for ``gpp-client``. This allows users to be able to use ToO features and modify exposure times. Updated the ``settings.py`` file to use the new ``GPP_ENV`` variable to set the environment for the ``gpp-client``. Instead of providing a URL, users can now specify the environment directly (e.g., 'DEVELOPMENT', 'STAGING', 'PRODUCTION'). This change simplifies configuration and improves clarity when setting up the client for different environments.
