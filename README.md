[![Run Flake8](https://github.com/gemini-hlsw/goats/actions/workflows/run_flake8.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/gemini-hlsw/goats/actions/workflows/run_flake8.yaml)
[![Run Tests](https://github.com/gemini-hlsw/goats/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/gemini-hlsw/goats/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml)

This is an end-to-end integrated system for time-domain and multimesseneger astronomy (TDAMM) aimed towards Gemini follow-up observations.

Its objective is to simplify the TDAMM workflow for users by serving as a one-stop shop for all the follow-up needs. To this end, it will integrate the various TDAMM services of Gemini Observatory and the larger NOIRLab organization.
